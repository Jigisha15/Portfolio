This is my Portfolio website which displays my contact details, the projects that I've worked on and some information about be. It is hosted using vercel.

It is made using HTML, CSS and ReactJS framework. It has a very simple UI and you can use it to send me emails for collaborations or responses too.

For sending and recieving emails I've used EmailJs. To install it in your project simply run the command - npm install '@emailjs/browser' in  your terminal (if you have npm). Here is its documentation - https://www.emailjs.com/docs/

The public folder contains an index.html file, I have changed the title there.

The src folder contains the assets ie the images uploaded from my device.

The src/components folder contains the code to be reused.

The src/pages folder contains the code for the whole pages where the components are reused, data is mapped, and a whole page is developed.

To avoid hassle, I have created a seperate CSS file in the same folder of the component or page.

The App.css contains the css which has to be given to the whole website as a whole. (For example the background color or the font style)

The App.js basically contains the routes.
