This is my Portfolio website which displays my contact details, the projects that I've worked on and some information about be. It is hosted using vercel.

It is made using HTML, CSS and ReactJS framework. It has a very simple UI and you can use it to send me emails for collaborations or responses too.

For sending and recieving emails I've used EmailJs. To install it in your project simply run the command - npm install '@emailjs/browser' in  your terminal (if you have npm).
